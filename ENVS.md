# Custom Envs

- How to create a custom env from dockerfile if you want to use local files during the build step?
  - It's either you build the dockerfile locally or you package and upload the files to our infra so it can be used during the build step.



- Can we has the dockerfile+files+scripts/config to get the unique env hash that we can use to start identical envs in the future?
