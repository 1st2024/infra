# E2B Infrastructure

[E2B](https://e2b.dev) is an open-source infrastructure for AI code interpreting. In our main repository [e2b-dev/e2b](https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B) we are giving you SDKs and CLI to customize and manage environments and run your AI agents in the cloud.

This repository contains the infrastructure that powers the E2B platform.
